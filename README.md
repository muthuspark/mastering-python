## Clone the Repository

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muthuspark/js-interview-questions.git
```

## Run Quarto Preview

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd js-interview-questions
```

To preview the site locally, you'll need to have Quarto installed. If you don't have it yet, you can install Quarto by following the instructions on the [official Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

After installing Quarto, run the following command to start the preview:

```bash
quarto preview
```

This will generate a local server which will also open the site automatically in the default browser

## Render the Site

To render the site and generate the static files, run:

```bash
quarto render
```

This will create the necessary output files in the `_site` folder.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project by submitting new articles, improving existing content, or fixing bugs, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
