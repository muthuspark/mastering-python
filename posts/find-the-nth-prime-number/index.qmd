Finding the Nth prime number is a classic computer science problem that tests your understanding of prime numbers and algorithmic efficiency.  This post will explore several Python approaches to solving this, ranging from a basic, understandable method to more optimized solutions.


## Understanding Prime Numbers

Before diving into the code, let's quickly recap what prime numbers are. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.  In other words, it's only divisible by 1 and itself.  Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.


## Method 1: Basic Approach

This approach iterates through numbers, checking for primality until the Nth prime is found. While straightforward, it's not very efficient for larger values of N.

```python
def is_prime(num):
  """Checks if a number is prime."""
  if num <= 1:
    return False
  for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
    if num % i == 0:
      return False
  return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
  """Finds the nth prime number."""
  count = 0
  number = 2
  while count < n:
    if is_prime(number):
      count += 1
    number += 1
  return number - 1

nth = 10
prime = find_nth_prime(nth)
print(f"The {nth}th prime number is: {prime}")
```

This code first defines a function `is_prime` to efficiently check if a number is prime.  The `find_nth_prime` function then uses this to count primes until it reaches the desired Nth prime. The optimization in `is_prime` checks only up to the square root of the number, as any factor larger than the square root must have a corresponding factor smaller than it.


## Method 2: Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a significantly more efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified limit.  It's particularly beneficial when you need to find multiple primes or a high-numbered prime.

```python
def find_nth_prime_sieve(n):
  """Finds the nth prime number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes."""
  limit = n * 20  # Adjust limit as needed for larger n; this is a heuristic
  primes = [True] * (limit + 1)
  primes[0] = primes[1] = False

  for i in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):
    if primes[i]:
      for j in range(i * i, limit + 1, i):
        primes[j] = False

  count = 0
  for i in range(2, limit + 1):
    if primes[i]:
      count += 1
      if count == n:
        return i

nth = 100
prime = find_nth_prime_sieve(nth)
print(f"The {nth}th prime number is: {prime}")

```

The Sieve creates a boolean array to track prime numbers. It iteratively marks non-prime numbers, making it much faster than the previous method for larger N values.  Note that the `limit` needs to be adjusted based on `n` to ensure enough numbers are checked; the given formula is a heuristic that works well in practice.  More sophisticated estimations of the limit can be used for increased efficiency, but this simple heuristic is sufficient for many applications.


## Choosing the Right Method

The basic approach is easier to understand but becomes slow for larger N. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is far more efficient for finding higher-numbered primes, making it the preferred choice for most practical scenarios.  The selection depends on the trade-off between code simplicity and performance needs.
